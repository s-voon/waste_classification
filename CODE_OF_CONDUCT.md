# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

To promote an inclusive and respectful community, we as contributors and maintainers commit to ensuring participation in our project and community is free from harassment for all people, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation. We pledge to promote collaboration, respect differing viewpoints, and use inclusive language. We strive to create a welcoming space where everyone can participate and make a difference.

## Our Standards

We are expected to adhere to the following standards:

* Being open to collaboration and respectful of the community's processes.
* Acknowledging and appreciating the time and effort contributed by volunteers.
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.
* Being considerate and respectful of others.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.

In addition, we must refrain from inappropriate behaviors such as:

* Refrain from using sexual language, imagery, or unwanted sexual attention.
* Avoid trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Do not harass others publicly or privately.
* Do not share private information of others, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit consent.
* Avoid any other behavior that would be deemed unprofessional.
* Using exclusive, discriminatory or offensive language.

## Our Responsibilities

All participants are obligated to create a respectful and open-minded community environment. Maintainers of the project bear the crucial responsibility of setting the expectations for acceptable conduct, taking into account both the collaborative nature of the work and the diversity of the community. They must ensure that all discussions and contributions are in line with the established code of conduct, fostering a culture of constructive and polite discourse. Maintainers also hold the authority to moderate and intervene in any form of communication or contribution that falls outside the bounds of respectful behavior. This includes the modification or removal of inappropriate, offensive, or threatening comments, code, or any other contributions, as well as the suspension or expulsion of contributors who engage in harmful conduct.

## Scope

The Code of Conduct is a foundational framework that governs all participants' behavior within the project’s collaborative spaces, including issue trackers, pull requests, discussion boards, and all forms of communication related to the project’s operation. Additionally, it extends to any public domain where individuals are identified with or speak on behalf of the project or its community. This includes, but is not limited to, representation through official project email addresses, official social media presence, or community outreach activities. Official roles, such as community ambassadors or event representatives, also fall within this scope. The project maintainers may further delineate the bounds of representation, ensuring that all interactions remain true to the spirit of the project's ethos, both within the immediate project environment and the broader community it serves.

## Enforcement

Allegations of misconduct, including but not limited to harassment and abuse, should be promptly directed to the project team via email at [Sharon Voon](mailto:svoon12@gmail.com) for confidential handling. The team is committed to a thorough examination of all reports and will enact measures deemed suitable based on the situation. Confidentiality regarding the reporting party will be strictly upheld. Detailed enforcement policies are available and may be furnished upon request.

Project maintainers are entrusted with upholding the Code of Conduct and will be held accountable should they fail to execute their duties responsibly. Violations by maintainers will be subject to actions, up to and including temporary suspension or permanent removal from their position, as decided by the project's senior
